# Satellite-Station-Communication-Window
Graphs the viewing angle of a satellite orbiting mars from a landing site on the planets surface, including the effect J2 perturbations (precession of line of ascending nodes)

Inputs are satellites orbit (defined by orbital period, apoares and inclination), number of satellite orbits to take measurements
for and th number of measurements to take per orbital period.

Program then outputs a graph of the viewing angle for each degree of nodal precession (can limit range of nodal precession
by changin line 135 range), displays the longest communication window per 1 mars day in the simulation, and the satellites
apoares and periares.
